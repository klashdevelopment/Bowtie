# BOWTIE DISCORD is a work in progress feature! Webhook customization isn't implemented.
#
# Bowtie chooses to use Javacord as a lightweight Discord API wrapper.
# To make the bot work, you need to create a Discord bot and get the token.
# You can do this by going to https://discord.com/developers/applications
# and creating a new application. Then, create a bot and copy the token.
#
# Insert the token below and enable the discord feature.
token: "your-token-here"
enabled: false
# The channel ID where the bot will send messages.
channel-id: "your-channel-id-here"
# The server ID where the bot will send messages.
server-id: "your-server-id-here"
# Messages that the bot will send.
# Content can use either discord markdown or embed format.
#
# Embed format: "[EMBED]Title|Content|Color|ImageUrl"
# Title and Content are required using Discord markdown. Color and Image are optional.
#
# Placeholders avalible are %username% %displayname% %image%
messages:
  player-join: "[EMBED]%username% joined the game|Welcome to the server.|#00ff00|%image%"
  player-quit: "[EMBED]%username% left the game|See you next time|#ff0000|%image%"
  # Chats use a webhook for each player with their display name and icon.
  player-chat: "%message%"
